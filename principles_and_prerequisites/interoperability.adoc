## Interoperability

include::../attributes.adoc[]

This {eSENS} BIS structure is based on the
{EIF}[European Interoperability Framework 2.0].

It applies the Framework as follows:

. *Legal Interoperability*
  * Legal:
    **   {EU_Dir_24}[Directive 2014/24/EU]
    **  {EU_Dir_25}[Directive 2014/25/EU]
    **   {Reg_910}[Regulation 910/2014]

. *Organizational interoperability*

*   Organization (Organization/Business):
    **   This {eSENS} eTendering BIS supports only B2G
    **   This {eSENS} eTendering BIS supports cross border, regional and domestic tendering procedures in EU and EEA
    **   This {eSENS} eTendering BIS can function as a standardized EDI agreement within a trading community
    **   This {eSENS} eTendering BIS supports linking of business processes within the sending and receiving organization.
*   Organization (Process):
    **   This {eSENS} eTendering BIS supports a set of _“common business processes”_ that are assumed to be supported by most enterprises whether public or private. These are processes that are used widely or understood as being relevant for most companies.

. *Semantic interoperability*

*   Semantic:

** A minimum set of information elements required to conduct a procurement procedure. The set of information elements is assumed to be sufficient to support organizational business and processing requirements stated above.

***   A CORE:
        **** _Data model_, a set of elements that the receiver MUST be able to process.
        **** _Business rules_, a set of business rules that ensure a common way of processing the information elements. The rules are stated in a way that allows for automated validation of document instances.

. *Technical interoperability*

#Links must be added#

*   Technical Interaction (Process and semantic implementation):
    **   Binding to {SBDH}[SBDH] v1.3
    **   {ASIC}[ASIC-E] container with {CAdES}[CAdES] signature.
    **   Binding to {UBL}[UBL 2.1]:
    *** CWA3456 Part 218 UBL SIG - Trdm090 Tender.docx
        ***   CWA3456 Part 205 UBL SIG - Trdm045 Tender Reception Notification.docx
        ***   CWA3456 Part 119 Profile 54 - Tendering
    **   Validation:
        *** BIIRULES-UBL-T90.sch
        *** BIIRULES-UBL-T45.sch
        *** UBL-T90-eSENS.sch
