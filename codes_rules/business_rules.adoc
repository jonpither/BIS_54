== Business rules
include::../attributes.adoc[]

The below listed business rules are additional rules added by the {eSENS} pilot project, to ensure valid instance documents, and to ensure that identifiers needed in the {PEPPOl} Transport infrastructure are present.

IMPORTANT: Additional business rules are listed in the {CENBII} documents, and these cannot be violated if the instance document is to be valid!
